Fig1: Schematic diagram: a) DA Framework, b) Empirical Local patch, c) Altimetry Mapping Procedure
Fig2: Comparison of local patches
Fig3: Boxplot to compare rKGE, rCC, rBR, and rRV for each experiment 
Fig4: Map of rKGE of best median rKGE experiment
Fig5: Where rKGE is better uparea, elevation at the target pixel
Fig6: local patch characteristics --> local patch size
open loop [WSE] --> mean RMSE, max RMSE, weighted RMSE (observation localization weight)
open loop [WSE] --> bias
open loop [Q] --> bias, cc, rv
--> some discussion
Where rKGE is better regulated river, regulated river (capacity of dam/levee/diversion)
